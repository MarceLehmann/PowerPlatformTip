<img src="/assets/images/bio-photo.jfif" alt="Marcel Lehmann - Microsoft Power Platform MVP" style="float: right; margin: 0 0 1rem 2rem; width: 250px; border-radius: 50%;">

Hello, I'm **Marcel Lehmann**, a **Microsoft Business Applications (BizzApps) MVP** based in Switzerland. My journey into the Power Platform world started in 2017 from a rather unexpected place ‚Äì repetitive manual tasks that begged for automation.

Coming from a commercial apprenticeship background, I discovered the Power Platform while searching for ways to escape the endless cycle of repetitive work. My first automation? A simple Power Automate flow that notified my supervisor whenever a Planner task was completed. That small victory opened my eyes to a world of possibilities ‚Äì invest a little time upfront, save countless hours forever. This philosophy still drives my passion today.

Since then, my career has taken an incredible trajectory:
- üèÜ **Microsoft Switzerland Partner of the Year** - Achieved with my very first project at a consulting firm
- üéì **Certified Expert** - PL-900, PL-100, PL-200, PL-500 certified
- üåç **Diverse Experience** - Successfully delivered solutions for everything from one-person startups to corporations with 10,000+ employees
- üé§ **Active Speaker** - Regular presenter at various Microsoft Summits and conferences
- üë• **Community Leader** - Proud organizer of the [Power Platform User Group Switzerland (D-CH) - #PPUGS](https://www.linkedin.com/groups/12703022)

My expertise spans across:
- **Power Apps**: Custom application development and optimization
- **Power Automate**: Workflow automation and process optimization  
- **Copilot Studio (Power Virtual Agents)**: Conversational AI and chatbot development

Through [thepoweraddicts.ch](https://thepoweraddicts.ch/), I provide professional coaching, consulting, and training services with a focus on:
- Custom Power Platform solution implementation
