## About Marcel Lehmann

<img src="/assets/images/bio-photo.jfif" alt="Marcel Lehmann - Microsoft Power Platform MVP" style="float: right; margin: 0 0 1rem 2rem; width: 250px; border-radius: 50%; box-shadow: 0 4px 16px rgba(0,0,0,0.1);">

Hello, I'm **Marcel Lehmann**, a **Microsoft Business Applications (BizzApps) MVP** based in Switzerland 🇨🇭. My journey into the Power Platform world started in 2017 from a rather unexpected place – repetitive manual tasks that begged for automation.

### My Power Platform Journey

Coming from a commercial apprenticeship background, I discovered the Power Platform while searching for ways to escape the endless cycle of repetitive work. My first automation? A simple Power Automate flow that notified my supervisor whenever a Planner task was completed. That small victory opened my eyes to a world of possibilities – **invest a little time upfront, save countless hours forever**. This philosophy still drives my passion today.

### Recognition & Achievements

Since that first automation, my career has taken an incredible trajectory:

- 🏆 **Microsoft MVP (2023-Present)** - Recognized by Microsoft for exceptional community contributions and technical expertise
- 🥇 **Microsoft Switzerland Partner of the Year** - Achieved with my very first project at a consulting firm
- 🎓 **Microsoft Certified Expert** - PL-900, PL-100, PL-200, PL-500 certified
- 🌍 **Diverse Experience** - Successfully delivered solutions for everything from one-person startups to corporations with 10,000+ employees
- 🎤 **Active Speaker** - Regular presenter at Microsoft Summits and Power Platform conferences
- 👥 **Community Leader** - Proud organizer of the [Power Platform User Group Switzerland (D-CH) - #PPUGS](https://www.linkedin.com/groups/12703022)
