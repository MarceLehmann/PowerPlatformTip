> **TL;DR:** Get the lowest ID, highest ID and total count of a SharePoint list in Power Automate with three simple `$orderby`/`ItemCount` REST calls.

## 💡 Challenge
You need the highest, lowest, and total count of item IDs in a SharePoint list, to build reports, paginate, or manage data more efficiently, without scanning the whole list.

## ✅ Solution
Use three small HTTP requests against the SharePoint REST API to fetch the lowest ID, the highest ID and the total item count directly.

## 🔧 How It's Done

**1. Get the lowest ID**

🔸 Send an HTTP GET to the SharePoint API:
`/_api/Web/Lists/GetByTitle('YourListName')/Items?$select=ID&$filter=ID gt 0&$top=1&$orderby=ID asc`

🔸 Set the method to GET and the header `accept: application/json; odata=nometadata`.

**2. Get the highest ID**

🔸 Same request, ordered descending:
`/_api/Web/Lists/GetByTitle('YourListName')/Items?$select=ID&$filter=ID gt 0&$top=1&$orderby=ID desc`

🔸 Use the same method and headers.

**3. Get the total item count**

🔸 Call the ItemCount endpoint:
`/_api/Web/Lists/GetByTitle('YourListName')/ItemCount`

🔸 Again use GET with the same headers.

## 🎉 Result
You get the lowest, highest, and total count of IDs in your SharePoint list in seconds, perfect for reports and data analysis.

## 🌟 Key Advantages

🔸 Automated and fast data retrieval

🔸 Simplifies management of large lists

🔸 No manual searching required

## 🛠️ FAQ
**1. Do I need any special permissions to run these HTTP requests?**
You need at least read permissions on the SharePoint list to retrieve IDs and item counts via the API. Ensure your connection in Power Automate has the appropriate access.

**2. Can this approach handle large lists with more than 5,000 items?**
Yes. Retrieving the lowest or highest ID with `$top=1` is efficient, but be aware of list view thresholds when filtering larger datasets. For total count, the `ItemCount` endpoint stays performant.

**3. How can I adapt this to retrieve other columns or values?**
Adjust the `$select` and `$orderby` query parameters to include the desired fields (e.g., `Title`) and order by those columns as needed.
