# The Big 5: Variables and Parameters in PowerApps

*Photo by Ann H on [Pexels.com](https://www.pexels.com/photo/city-road-traffic-beach-2646530/)*

If you build PowerApps and search for solutions online, you'll frequently encounter these five functions:

- `Set()`
- `UpdateContext({})`
- `With()`
- `Navigate(..., ..., PARAMETER)`
- `Param()`

*Bonus*: You can also use collections (`Collect`, `ClearCollect`) for advanced scenarios.

Below, I’ll briefly explain how I use each and why you should consider them in your own apps.

## 1. Set()
The most well-known function. It sets the value of a **global variable**. Global variables are useful for storing values you want to use across multiple screens. Typical use cases:
- Setting style variables in `OnStart`
- Storing the logged-in user
- Selecting an item from a gallery to use elsewhere

```powerapps
Set(
  varUser,
  User()
)
```

## 2. UpdateContext({})
The little brother of `Set`. It sets the value of one or more **context variables** for the current screen. I mainly use this to toggle values (true/false) for showing/hiding elements, such as pop-ups or input windows.

```powerapps
UpdateContext({locPopUp: true});
UpdateContext({locPopUp: false})
```

## 3. With({})
A more recent discovery for me, `With` stores variables **exclusively for a function** and they can only be referenced within that function. I use this mainly inside functions when I need to reuse a value multiple times.

```powerapps
With(
  {locText: TextInput1.Text},
  If(
    IsBlank(locText),
    "noText",
    TextInput1.Text
  )
)
```

## 4. Navigate(..., ..., {PARAMETER})
This parameter feature is often overlooked. By adding two more commas after `Navigate`, you can pass one or more parameters to the target screen using curly braces. These parameters are only available on the next screen (unless you store them in another variable or pass them again).

```powerapps
Navigate(
  Screen1,
  UnCover,
  {locVariableNextScreen: "Yes we can use it"}
)
```

## 5. Param()
Provides access to parameters passed to the app when a user opens it. This is less commonly used, as it’s typically appended to the app’s URL. It allows you to navigate users to a specific page or pass values to the app.

Example: Passing the parameter `Admin=true` in the URL. In `OnStart`, set the global variable `varAdmin` with the parameter value to enable admin settings.

```
https://apps.powerapps.com/play/543654354453543543?tenantId=dasfdgdsgsfsdfsdf&Admin=true

Set(varAdmin, Param("Admin"))
```

## Bonus Tip: Boolean Toggle
If you use a variable as a boolean and want to always flip its value, use `!` in front of the variable. This reverses the value each time it’s executed.

```powerapps
UpdateContext({locPopUp: !locPopUp})
```

## Collections
For more advanced scenarios, consider using collections:
- `Collect()`
- `ClearCollect()`

Collections allow you to store tables of data locally in your app for flexible manipulation and display.
