> **TL;DR:** Filter SharePoint data at the source with OData Filter Query expressions in Get items to retrieve only the records you need.

## 💡 Challenge
Filtering data within SharePoint via Power Automate can be cumbersome, particularly with large lists and intricate filter conditions.

## ✅ Solution
Employ OData query options in Power Automate's standard SharePoint connectors to refine and streamline your queries.

## 🔧 How It's Done
Here's how to do it:
1. Configure the SharePoint action filter  
   🔸 Use the **Filter Query** option in **Get items**  
   🔸 Or in **Get files (properties only)**
2. Build your OData query using operators  
   🔸 **eq** (Equal): Filters items where a field equals a value  
   🔸 **ne** (Not Equal): Excludes items where a field equals a value  
   🔸 **gt** (Greater Than): Includes items where a field's value is greater than a value  
   🔸 **ge** (Greater Than or Equal): Includes items where a field's value is ≥ a value  
   🔸 **lt** (Less Than): Includes items where a field's value is less than a value  
   🔸 **le** (Less Than or Equal): Includes items where a field's value is ≤ a value  
   🔸 **and** (And): Combines conditions; all must be true  
   🔸 **or** (Or): Combines conditions; any can be true  
   🔸 **not** (Not): Negates a condition  
   🔸 **startswith** (Starts With): Field value begins with a substring  
   🔸 **endswith** (Ends With): Field value ends with a substring  
   🔸 **substringof** (Substring Of): Field value contains a substring

## 🎉 Result
This method enables more sophisticated and efficient queries, ensuring your workflows are optimized and only the necessary data is retrieved.

## 🌟 Key Advantages
🔸 Precision: Exact data retrieval with specific OData filters.  
🔸 Efficiency: Minimize data processing and server load by fetching only needed data.  
🔸 Flexibility: Craft complex queries by mixing various OData options to meet your needs.

## 🛠️ FAQ
**1. What is the Filter Query option in Power Automate?**

The Filter Query option lets you apply an OData expression directly in SharePoint actions like Get items or Get files, so only matching records are retrieved.

**2. Which OData operators can I use in Power Automate?**

Power Automate supports common OData operators such as eq, ne, gt, ge, lt, le, and, or, not, startswith, endswith, and substringof for flexible filtering.

**3. How do I format date or text values in an OData query?**

Enclose text values in single quotes (e.g., Title eq 'Report') and format dates in ISO 8601 (e.g., Created ge 2023-12-01T00:00:00Z) to avoid errors.
