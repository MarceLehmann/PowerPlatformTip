## 💡 Challenge
In Power Apps, resetting multiple controls to their default state can be tedious and clutters your code when using individual Reset functions, making the app less efficient.

## ✅ Solution
Use a single context variable to reset all linked controls globally, simplifying your code and improving app performance.

## 🔧 How It's Done
Here's how to do it:
1. Create a Context Variable  
   🔸 Initialize a context variable, e.g., `ResetVar`, in the app’s OnStart or screen’s `OnVisible` property.  
   🔸 Example: `OnVisible = UpdateContext({ ResetVar: false })`  
2. Link to Controls  
   🔸 Set each control’s **Reset** property to `ResetVar`.  
   🔸 Only linked controls will reset when `ResetVar` changes.  
3. Trigger Reset  
   🔸 Add a button or action and toggle the variable:  
     `OnSelect = UpdateContext({ ResetVar: !ResetVar })`  
   🔸 This single action resets all linked controls at once.

## 🎉 Result
You now have a mechanism that resets all linked controls globally with one action, resulting in cleaner code and a more efficient app.

## 🌟 Key Advantages
🔸 Efficiency: Reset all controls with a single toggle, reducing development effort.  
🔸 Cleaner Code: Avoid repetitive Reset calls, leading to maintainable app logic.  
🔸 Improved User Experience: Provide a fast, seamless reset for end-users.

## 🛠️ FAQ
**1. How do I initialize the ResetVar?**  
Set it in a screen’s `OnVisible` property or the app’s `OnStart` using `UpdateContext` or `Set`.

**2. Can I reset only a subset of controls?**  
Yes. Link only the controls you want to reset by setting their **Reset** property to `ResetVar`.

**3. What if a control doesn’t reset as expected?**  
Ensure its **Reset** property is correctly bound to `ResetVar` and that you’re toggling the variable in your action’s `OnSelect`.
