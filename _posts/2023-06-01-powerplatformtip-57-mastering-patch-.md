## 💡 Challenge
We often use the PATCH function to modify individual records, but updating each row one by one can be slow, error-prone, and adds complexity to your app’s code.

## ✅ Solution
Use the PATCH function to update or insert an entire table (Collection) in one go, improving performance and maintaining data consistency.

## 🔧 How It's Done
Here's how to do it:
1. Prepare your source table  
   🔸 Create a Collection or table containing all records you want to update.  
   🔸 Ensure that column names and data types match those of the target table.  
2. Apply the PATCH function  
   🔸 Use the syntax: `Patch(TargetTable, SourceCollection)`  
   🔸 This single call updates or inserts all records in bulk.  
3. Verify the update  
   🔸 Check the target table to ensure all changes were applied correctly.  
   🔸 Benefit from faster performance and cleaner code.  

## 🎉 Result
You can now update multiple records in one operation, boosting your app's speed and responsiveness while reducing code complexity and ensuring data integrity.

## 🌟 Key Advantages
🔸 Efficiency: Update or insert multiple records simultaneously, reducing server calls.  
🔸 Data Integrity: Execute all changes in one operation to maintain consistency.  
🔸 Simplicity: Eliminate loops and complex logic, keeping your code clean.

## 🛠️ FAQ
**1. Can I use PATCH on any data source?**  
Most connectors that support delegation (such as Dataverse or SharePoint) allow bulk PATCH operations, but always verify limits and delegation warnings.

**2. What happens if column names or data types don’t match?**  
The operation will fail or skip mismatched fields. Ensure your source table’s schema aligns exactly with the target table before patching.

**3. Will PATCH overwrite existing records not included in the source?**  
PATCH only updates records present in the source. Records not included remain unchanged, which helps avoid unintended data loss.
