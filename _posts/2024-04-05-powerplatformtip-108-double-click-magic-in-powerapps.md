## ðŸ’¡ Challenge
How can we utilize both single and double clicks on the same button in PowerApps to perform separate actions, reflecting the state of interaction more accurately?

## âœ… Solution
Implement a method that leverages a combination of a click counter and a timer to differentiate between single and double clicks, executing actions accordingly.

## ðŸ”§ How It's Done
Here's how to do it:
1. Click Tracking  
   ðŸ”¸ Increment `locPopUp` variable to count clicks.  
   ðŸ”¸ Use in OnSelect:  
   powerapps
   UpdateContext({locPopUp: locPopUp + 1})
   
2. Timer Initiation  
   ðŸ”¸ Start the timer by setting `locPopUpTimer` to true.  
   ðŸ”¸ Use in OnSelect:  
   powerapps
   UpdateContext({locPopUpTimer: true});
   
3. Timer Configuration  
   ðŸ”¸ Set the timerâ€™s Duration to 1000 (milliseconds).  
   ðŸ”¸ Enable AutoStart on the timer control.  
4. Action Determination  
   ðŸ”¸ In the timerâ€™s OnTimerEnd, check the `locPopUp` count.  
   ðŸ”¸ Reset `locPopUpTimer` to false:  
   powerapps
   UpdateContext({locPopUpTimer: false})
