## 💡 Challenge
Working with dates and times often requires using formatDateTime with utcNow to format values, adding unnecessary complexity and extra steps in your flow.

## ✅ Solution
Format the date directly within utcNow by passing your desired format string, eliminating the separate formatDateTime function.

## 🔧 How It's Done
Here's how to do it:
1. Use utcNow with format parameter  
   🔸 Instead of using `formatDateTime(utcNow(), 'your-format')`, call `utcNow('your-format')`.  
2. Apply your date-time format  
   🔸 Use the same format string you need directly inside `utcNow`.  
3. Test your flow  
   🔸 Run and verify your flow in a non-production environment to ensure it works as expected.

## 🎉 Result
By directly formatting dates within utcNow, you simplify and streamline your flows, reducing steps and improving readability and performance.

## 🌟 Key Advantages
🔸 Simplicity: Eliminates the need for an additional `formatDateTime` function.  
🔸 Efficiency: Reduces the number of steps in your flow, boosting performance.  
🔸 Clarity: Makes your flow easier to read and maintain.
