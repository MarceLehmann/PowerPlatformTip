## 💡 Challenge
Creating SharePoint list items one by one in Power Automate can be slow and consumes many API actions, especially when dealing with hundreds of items.

## ✅ Solution
Leverage the SharePoint REST batch endpoint to bundle up to 1,000 create-item requests into a single HTTP call.

## 🔧 How It's Done
Here's how to do it:
1. Add an HTTP request action in Power Automate.  
   🔸 Site Address: Your SharePoint site URL.  
   🔸 Method: POST  
   🔸 URL: `_api/$batch`  
2. Configure headers and body.  
   🔸 Headers:  
     - Accept: `application/json;odata=verbose`  
     - Content-Type: `multipart/mixed; boundary="batch_12345"`  
   🔸 Body: Construct a batch payload with multiple subrequests for creating items.  
3. Parse the response.  
   🔸 The HTTP action returns a multipart response containing each subresponse.  
   🔸 Use a “Parse JSON” action to read success or failure for each item.  
4. Handle errors and logging.  
   🔸 Loop through responses to identify and retry failed creations.  
   🔸 Log results or send notifications as needed.

## 🎉 Result
By batching requests, you can create up to 1,000 SharePoint list items in a single operation, dramatically improving flow performance and reducing the number of API calls.

## 🌟 Key Advantages
🔸 Massive performance boost for bulk operations.  
🔸 Fewer API calls, reducing risk of throttling.  
🔸 Easier error handling and logging for large data sets.

## 🛠️ FAQ
**1. What's the maximum number of items I can batch create in SharePoint?**  
SharePoint REST API supports up to 1,000 operations per batch request, making it highly efficient for bulk operations.

**2. How do I handle partial failures when some items in the batch fail?**  
Parse the batch response to identify failed items by their status codes, then retry those specific items or log them for manual review.

**3. Can I use batch operations for updating and deleting items too?**  
Yes, the batch method supports CREATE, UPDATE, and DELETE operations, allowing you to mix different operations in a single batch request.
