## 💡 Challenge
Managing permissions and ownership in the Center of Excellence (CoE) Kit can be difficult. It’s hard to know who has access to flows and apps, and orphaned resources get left behind when people leave the company.

## ✅ Solution
Leverage the CoE Kit’s built-in tools—‘Set Flow Permissions’, ‘Set Apps Permissions’ and the orphan detection flow—to gain clear visibility, manage access, and automatically handle orphaned flows and apps.

## 🔧 How It's Done
Here's how to do it:
1. Use the Set Flow Permissions tool in the CoE Kit.  
   🔸 View which users have access to each flow.  
   🔸 Assign new flow permissions directly within the tool.
2. Use the Set Apps Permissions tool in the CoE Kit.  
   🔸 View which users have access to each app.  
   🔸 Assign new app permissions quickly and securely.
3. Enable the orphan flow and apps detection flow under Governance Components.  
   🔸 Identify flows and apps without an owner.  
   🔸 Automatically alert the departed user’s manager to reassign permissions.

## 🎉 Result
You gain comprehensive visibility into who can access your resources, streamline permission management, and ensure no flow or app remains orphaned—improving security and operational efficiency.

## 🌟 Key Advantages
🔸 Complete visibility of user permissions for flows and apps.  
🔸 Simplified management of access rights directly from the CoE Kit.  
🔸 Automated detection and handling of orphaned flows and apps.
