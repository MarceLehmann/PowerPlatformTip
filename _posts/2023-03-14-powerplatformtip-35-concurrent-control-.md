## 💡 Challenge
Managing multiple instances of a Power Automate flow can lead to data duplication and conflicts, especially when flows run in parallel and manipulate the same data set.

## ✅ Solution
Enable the Concurrency Control feature in Power Automate and set the degree of parallelism to 1 to ensure flows run sequentially, eliminating duplicates and conflicts.

## 🔧 How It's Done
Here's how to do it:
1. Navigate to your flow’s trigger settings.  
   🔸 Open the flow in Power Automate.  
   🔸 Click the trigger’s ellipsis (…) and choose “Settings.”
2. Enable Concurrency Control and set parallelism to 1.  
   🔸 Toggle on the “Concurrency Control” option.  
   🔸 Enter “1” for the degree of parallelism.
3. Validate sequential execution.  
   🔸 Confirm only one instance runs at a time.  
   🔸 Check additional triggers queue for execution after the current run.

## 🎉 Result
A more reliable and efficient automation process where data integrity is maintained and the risk of conflicts and duplicates is minimized.

## 🌟 Key Advantages
🔸 Data Integrity: Ensures each flow instance accesses and modifies data without interference.  
🔸 Sequential Execution: Queues flow instances for an orderly and predictable run sequence.  
🔸 Conflict Reduction: Limits concurrent runs to significantly reduce data conflicts.

## 🛠️ FAQ
**1. What happens to flows that are triggered while another instance is running?**  
When concurrency control is set to 1, additional triggers are queued and will execute sequentially after the current instance completes.

**2. Can I set concurrency control to values other than 1?**  
Yes, you can set it to any value between 1-50, but higher values allow parallel execution which may reintroduce conflicts.

**3. Does concurrency control affect flow performance?**  
It may increase total processing time since flows run sequentially, but it ensures data integrity and prevents conflicts in critical scenarios.
