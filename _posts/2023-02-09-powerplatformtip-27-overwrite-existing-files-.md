## 💡 Challenge
You want to overwrite existing files in SharePoint using Power Automate's **Create File** action – but the **Overwrite** toggle is missing or greyed out!

## ✅ Solution
Disable the **Allow Chunking** setting in your SharePoint connector – this instantly unlocks the **Overwrite** option.

## 🔧 How It's Done

![SharePoint Create File Settings - Allow Chunking disabled to enable Overwrite](/assets/images/posts/powerplatformtip-27-overwrite.jpg "Disable Allow Chunking to unlock Overwrite")

1. Open your **Create File** action in Power Automate.  
2. Click **Settings** (top right of the action).  
3. Scroll to **Content Transfer** section.  
4. Set **Allow Chunking** to **Off**.  
5. Close Settings – the **Overwrite** toggle now appears in your action!

## ⚠️ Trade-offs
🔸 **100 MB Limit**: With chunking disabled, files larger than 100 MB will fail. Keep chunking enabled for large file scenarios.  
🔸 **Version History**: Overwriting replaces the file entirely. Enable SharePoint versioning if you need rollback capability.

## 🎉 Result
Your files get cleanly replaced without duplicates – no delete-then-create workarounds needed.

## 🌟 Key Advantages
🔸 **One-Click Fix**: A simple settings toggle – no extra actions in your flow.  
🔸 **Faster Flows**: Skip the "check if exists → delete → create" dance.  
🔸 **Cleaner Libraries**: No more \`filename(1).docx\` clutter.

## 🛠️ FAQ
**1. Why is the Overwrite option hidden by default?**  
Microsoft enables chunking by default to support large files (up to 250 MB). Since chunked uploads can't overwrite, the toggle is hidden until you disable chunking.

**2. What happens if my file exceeds 100 MB?**  
The flow will fail with a size limit error. For files larger than 100 MB, keep chunking enabled and use a delete-then-create pattern instead.

**3. Does overwriting preserve sharing permissions?**  
Yes, overwriting maintains existing sharing links, permissions, and metadata. The file ID stays the same.

**4. Can I use this for OneDrive too?**  
OneDrive for Business has the Overwrite toggle available by default – no settings hack needed there!
