## 💡 Challenge
Understanding the difference between `Lookup(Source, Condition, COLUMN)` vs `Lookup(Source, Condition).COLUMN` and optimizing your formulas for better performance.

## ✅ Solution
Use the direct-column syntax `Lookup(Source, Condition, COLUMN)` to retrieve only the needed value and avoid the extra record retrieval step.

## 🔧 How It's Done
Here's how to do it:
1. Use direct-column syntax  
   🔸 Syntax: `Lookup(Source, Condition, COLUMN)`  
   🔸 Benefit: Returns only the column value, improving performance.  
2. Avoid record-first syntax  
   🔸 Syntax: `Lookup(Source, Condition).COLUMN`  
   🔸 Drawback: Retrieves the entire record then extracts the column, which is less efficient.  
3. Example comparison  
   🔸 `Lookup(MyCollection, Age > 30, Name)` returns "Name" directly.  
   🔸 `Lookup(MyCollection, Age > 30).Name` finds the record then extracts "Name."

## 🎉 Result
By using the direct-column syntax, your app retrieves only what you need, leading to smoother performance and faster screen loads.

## 🌟 Key Advantages
🔸 Faster data retrieval by avoiding full-record fetch  
🔸 Simplified formulas that are easier to read  
🔸 Reduced network and memory usage in your app

## 🛠️ FAQ
**1. What is the difference between `Lookup(Source, Condition, COLUMN)` and `Lookup(Source, Condition).COLUMN`?**  
The first syntax returns the column value directly from the first matching record, while the second fetches the entire record then extracts the column, adding an extra step.

**2. When should I use the direct-column syntax?**  
Use it whenever you only need a single value from the matching record to improve performance and reduce data transfer.

**3. Can I always rely on `Lookup(Source, Condition, COLUMN)`?**  
Yes, but it only returns the first match. If you need multiple records or more complex logic, consider using `Filter` or other functions accordingly.
