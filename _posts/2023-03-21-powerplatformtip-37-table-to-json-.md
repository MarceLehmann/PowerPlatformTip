## 💡 Challenge
Working with two-column tables, specifically 'Name' and 'Value' pairs, in Power Automate can be tedious when trying to access individual entries efficiently.

## ✅ Solution
A simple method to streamline the selection of individual entries within such tables by converting the data into a JSON record and utilizing the "Parse JSON" action.

## 🔧 How It's Done
Here's how to do it:
1. Convert your 'Name' and 'Value' table into a JSON record.  
   🔸 This transformation allows for more flexible data manipulation.  
   🔸 Prepares data for the Parse JSON action.
2. Use the "Parse JSON" action in Power Automate.  
   🔸 You define a JSON schema to enforce structure.  
   🔸 Enables straightforward access to any entry within your flow.

## 🎉 Result
An enhanced Power Automate experience where accessing and selecting data from two-column tables becomes seamless, saving time and reducing complexity.

## 🌟 Key Advantages
🔸 Efficiency: Quickly convert tabular data into a manipulable format.  
🔸 Simplicity: Access individual data points easily without complex expressions.  
🔸 Flexibility: Adapt and extend this method for various data structures beyond simple name-value pairs.

## 🛠️ FAQ
**1. Can this method handle tables with multiple columns beyond name-value pairs?**  
Yes, but you'll need to modify the JSON structure to accommodate additional columns, creating more complex object structures.

**2. What happens if my table contains special characters or spaces in the names?**  
Special characters may need escaping in JSON. Consider using the replace() function to sanitize field names before conversion.

**3. Is there a size limit for tables when converting to JSON?**  
While there's no strict limit, very large tables may impact flow performance. Consider batch processing for tables with thousands of rows.
