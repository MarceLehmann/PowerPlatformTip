## 💡 Challenge
You have created a complex flow in PowerAutomate and want to make sure everything works as expected—without activating the flow and taking risks?

2. Click on "Test" and select the preview option.
3. Simulate the desired inputs and check the execution steps.
4. Analyze the results and adjust the flow if necessary.

## 🎉 Result
The Preview feature saves you time, prevents errors in live operation, and allows you to improve flows iteratively.

## 🌟 Key Advantages
- Detect and fix errors early
