## 💡 Challenge
Maintaining up-to-date data in PowerApps galleries is crucial for user experience. However, relying solely on the Refresh function reloads all data and can impact performance.

## ✅ Solution
Use a Boolean variable to trigger selective gallery data refresh, avoiding full data reloads and enhancing performance.

## 🔧 How It's Done
Here's how to do it:

1. Create a Boolean variable to control refresh.
   🔸 Example: `Set(varRefreshGallery, false)` in the App's OnStart.
   🔸 This variable determines when the gallery should update.

2. Toggle the variable when refresh is needed.
   🔸 Add a button or icon with `OnSelect: Set(varRefreshGallery, true)`.
   🔸 This signals the gallery to refresh its data source.

3. Use the variable in the gallery's Items property.
   🔸 Example:

   ```
   If(
       varRefreshGallery,
       Refresh(MyDataSource);
       Set(varRefreshGallery, false)
   );
   MyDataSource
   ```

   🔸 After the refresh, reset the variable to false.

## 🎉 Result
You achieve a more responsive and efficient app, refreshing only when needed and improving the user experience.

## 🌟 Key Advantages
🔸 Improved performance by avoiding unnecessary full data reloads.

🔸 Enhanced user experience with faster, targeted updates.

🔸 Greater control over when and how data is refreshed in your app.

## 🛠️ FAQ
**1. Can I use this technique with multiple galleries in the same app?**

Yes, you can create separate Boolean variables for each gallery to control their refresh independently.

**2. Does this method work with all data sources?**

This technique works with most PowerApps data sources, including SharePoint, Dataverse, and SQL Server connectors.

**3. How does this compare to using the Refresh() function directly?**

Using a Boolean variable gives you more control over when refreshes occur and can prevent unnecessary API calls compared to direct Refresh() usage.
