## 💡 Challenge
Do you often struggle to understand complex JSON outputs in Power Automate? Reading raw JSON can be time-consuming and error-prone, especially when dealing with nested structures.

## ✅ Solution
Use a JSON Viewer to easily visualize and understand the structure of your JSON outputs—speeding up your debugging and enhancing your flow logic.

## 🔧 How It's Done
Here's how to do it:

1. Copy the JSON output from any Power Automate step.  
   🔸 Click on the “Peek code” or “Outputs” section in the failed or successful step.  
   🔸 Highlight and copy the JSON block.

2. Open a JSON Viewer tool online or use browser extensions.  
   🔸 Tools like https://jsonformatter.org or https://jsonviewer.stack.hu are helpful.  
   🔸 Paste your JSON and expand/collapse the hierarchy for better readability.

3. Analyze the structure to understand properties and nesting.  
   🔸 Use this insight to reference the correct paths in dynamic content.  
   🔸 This helps in composing expressions with accuracy and speed.

## 🎉 Result
With the JSON Viewer, you can easily understand complex output structures in Power Automate. This leads to faster debugging, fewer errors, and overall better flow development.

## 🌟 Key Advantages
🔸 Saves time when troubleshooting flows  
🔸 Improves accuracy in dynamic content expressions  
🔸 Makes learning JSON structure intuitive and easy
