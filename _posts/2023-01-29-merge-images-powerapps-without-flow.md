I'm proud to present you an amazing component for PowerApps from my talented brother [Martin Lehmann](https://www.linkedin.com/in/ml92/)!

Gone are the days of struggling with third-party tools or Power Automate to add notes or drawings to existing images. Martin's component makes it all simple. You can easily overlay multiple images, make notes, and save the final image all in one place.
