## ðŸ’¡ Challenge
You need the latest entry from a SharePoint list in PowerApps, but the direct approach seems out of reach.

## âœ… Solution
Employ SortByColumns to order the list by ID in descending order, then use First to select the top item.

## ðŸ”§ How It's Done
Here's how to do it:
1. Utilize `SortByColumns` on the SharePoint data source to order by ID descending.  
   ðŸ”¸ Use `SortByColumns(DataSource, "ID", Descending)`.  
   ðŸ”¸ This arranges items so the latest entry appears first.  
2. Wrap the sorted result with `First` to grab the top item.  
   ðŸ”¸ Apply `First(...)` around the `SortByColumns` expression.  
   ðŸ”¸ Retrieves the most recent list entry efficiently.

## ðŸŽ‰ Result
This method ensures you access the most recent item from your SharePoint list in PowerApps, bypassing the Last function limitation.

## ðŸŒŸ Key Advantages
ðŸ”¸ Simplicity and efficiency: straightforward access to the newest list items.  
ðŸ”¸ Versatility: adapt the sort by any column for different scenarios.  
ðŸ”¸ Native PowerApps integration: enhances logic without complex workarounds.
