## 💡 Challenge
Automated notification emails often arrive with no clue which Power Automate flow or system triggered them, slowing support and audits.

## ✅ Solution
Embed a unique identifier in the sender address using plus addressing (`user+tag@domain.com`). The email itself now reveals its origin.

## 🔧 How It's Done
Here's how to do it:
1. Choose a clear tag, e.g. `guest-management` or `invoice-processing`  
   🔸 Example tag: `guest-management`  
2. Configure the sending system or Cloud Flow to use the address `user+tag@company.com`  
   🔸 `marcel.lehmann+guestmanagement@company.com`  
3. Gmail / Google Workspace works the same way  
   🔸 `marcel.lehmann+newsletter@gmail.com`  
4. (Optional) Create inbox rules or labels that sort or flag messages automatically.

## 🎉 Result
Every incoming email clearly shows which workflow generated it, cutting troubleshooting time to seconds and simplifying compliance reports.

## 🌟 Key Advantages
🔸 Immediate source identification  
🔸 Faster troubleshooting for IT and support  
🔸 Simplified audit and compliance tracking  
🔸 Zero extra licensing or infrastructure cost

## 🛠️ FAQ
**1. Does plus addressing survive corporate mail gateways?**  
Most modern gateways keep everything before "@" intact; only rare legacy filters strip the tag. Test first.  

**2. Can I assign multiple tags to the same project?**  
Yes. Use addresses like `projectX+finance@company.com` and `projectX+it@company.com` to separate streams.  

**3. Are there security concerns?**  
Avoid including sensitive information in the tag; use generic labels or numeric IDs instead.
