> **TL;DR:** Automate Word documents for free using Quick Parts placeholders filled by a standard Power Automate flow – no premium license needed.

## 💡 Challenge
The assumption that document automation in Word necessitates a premium subscription can deter users, particularly when it involves integrating external data, like from SharePoint.

## ✅ Solution
Utilizing Power Automate in conjunction with Quick Parts within Microsoft Word enables complex document automation tasks to be accomplished without requiring a premium subscription.

## 🔧 How It's Done
🔸In Microsoft Word, go to the "Insert" tab, select "Quick Parts," then "Document Property" to set up placeholders for data integration.
🔸Create a flow in Power Automate to fetch data from your chosen data source, such as a SharePoint list.
🔸In Power Automate, use the specific action to populate the Quick Parts in your Word document with data, replacing the placeholders with dynamic content from your data source.
🔸Set up the automation to save or send the document automatically, finalizing the process.

## 🎉 Result
The end result is an automatically generated document that is dynamically filled with the latest data from your selected source, all without incurring additional premium service fees.

## 🌟 Key Advantages
🔸Eliminates the need for premium subscriptions for advanced document automation.
🔸Saves time and increases efficiency by automating manual document preparation tasks.
🔸Reduces errors by minimizing manual data entry.
🔸Offers greater flexibility and customization in the creation of documents.
