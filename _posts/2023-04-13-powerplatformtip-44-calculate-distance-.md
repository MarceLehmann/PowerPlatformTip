## üí° Challenge
How can you calculate the distance between two points (e.g., addresses or coordinates) in Power Platform apps?

## ‚úÖ Solution
Use the Haversine formula or built-in geolocation services in PowerApps/Power Automate to determine the distance between two locations. This is useful for logistics, field service, or travel apps.

## üîß How It's Done
1. Collect latitude and longitude for both locations (e.g., via user input or device location).
2. Apply the Haversine formula in PowerApps or a custom Power Automate step to calculate the distance.
3. Display or use the result in your app or flow.

## üéâ Result
You can now provide users with real-time distance calculations for a variety of business scenarios.

## üõ†Ô∏è FAQ
**1. What is the Haversine formula?**
A mathematical formula to calculate the great-circle distance between two points on a sphere given their longitudes and latitudes.

**2. Can I use this in both PowerApps and Power Automate?**
Yes, you can implement the logic in both platforms using formulas or expressions.

**3. Are there built-in connectors for geolocation?**
PowerApps and Power Automate support geolocation via device sensors or external APIs.
