## 🔧 How It's Done
Here's how to do it:
1. Copy the environment ID and app ID from your PowerApps4Teams app.

   🔸 App ID: the unique identifier of your Teams app.  
2. Open any PowerApps app in edit mode.  
   🔸 In make.powerapps.com, select an app and click **Edit**.  
   🔸 Copy the URL from the browser’s address bar.  
3. Replace the IDs in the URL.  
   🔸 Paste your environment ID in place of the existing one.  
   🔸 Replace the app ID segment with your Teams app’s ID.  
4. Press Enter to load the modified URL.  
   🔸 The PowerApps studio opens your Teams app for editing.  
   🔸 Make your changes just like in any other PowerApp.

## 🛠️ FAQ
**1. How do I find the environment and app IDs for my Teams app?**  
You can find both IDs in the app’s details within make.powerapps.com. Open your Teams app in Teams, click **Edit** to launch the PowerApps studio, and note the IDs in the browser URL or in the app settings.

**2. Can I use this hack for any PowerApps4Teams app?**  
Yes. As long as the app exists in the environment, you can replace the IDs in any edit URL to open that Teams app directly in the PowerApps studio.

**3. Is this supported by Microsoft or just a workaround?**  
This is an unofficial workaround. While it uses the standard PowerApps studio, it’s not officially documented by Microsoft. Use it to boost productivity but be aware it may change with future updates.
