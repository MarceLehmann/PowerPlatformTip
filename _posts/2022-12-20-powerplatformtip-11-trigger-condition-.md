## 💡 Challenge  
Ever had a flow trigger when it shouldn’t, or fail to trigger when it should? Setting up multiple start conditions directly in the trigger can be tricky. Without a clear approach, flows may run too often, waste resources, or not run at all because the conditions are misconfigured.

## ✅ Solution  
Insert a **Filter Array** action before the actual trigger. Define all of your conditions in the Filter Array interface, switch to **Advanced Mode** to reveal the underlying expression, copy it, and paste it into the flow’s *Trigger Condition* field. This leverages Power Automate’s logic engine to generate the correct JSON expression for you.

## 🔧 How It's Done  
1. Preparation  
   🔸 Identify the exact scenarios under which your flow should start. Think of it like making a checklist before going on a trip—everything must check out before departure.  
   🔸 List the logic points (e.g., field value comparisons, status checks) that need to be true.  

2. Add Filter Array  
   🔸 After your trigger (for example, “When an item is created”), insert the **Filter array** action.  
   🔸 Build all desired conditions using the visual interface. You’ll immediately see which items pass and which are filtered out.  

3. Switch to Advanced Mode  
   🔸 In the **Filter array** step, click “Edit in advanced mode.”  
   🔸 Power Automate will display the JSON expression behind your conditions. Copy this expression—everything your trigger needs is already there.  

4. Apply to Trigger  
   🔸 Open the settings of your original **flow trigger** and locate the **Trigger Condition** field.  
   🔸 Paste the copied JSON expression into that field and save your flow. Done!

## 🎉 Result  
Your flow now only fires when every defined Filter Array condition is met. No more unwanted triggers, no wasted runs—your automation runs lean and efficient.

## 🌟 Key Advantages  
🔸 **Precision:** Your flow triggers only when the exact requirements are satisfied—no false starts.  
🔸 **Efficiency:** Pre-filtering reduces unnecessary flow executions, saving time and resources.  
🔸 **Flexibility:** Complex combinations of conditions can be implemented without writing code.

## 🛠️ FAQ  
**1. What is a trigger condition in Power Automate?**  
Trigger conditions are expressions evaluated before a flow runs. The flow only executes if they return true—everything else is ignored, preventing unwanted executions.

**2. Why use Filter Array before writing the trigger condition directly?**  
With **Filter Array**, you build rules in a clear, visual interface. In **Advanced Mode**, Power Automate automatically generates the correct JSON expression. You simply copy and paste it into the trigger—no manual expression writing or guesswork.

**3. How can I test if my trigger condition works correctly?**  
➤ Run the flow with only the **Filter Array** step to see which items pass through.  
➤ Copy the expression string and paste it into **Trigger Condition**.  
➤ Test the flow with sample data: it should only proceed when all conditions are satisfied.
