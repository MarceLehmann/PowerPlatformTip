## ðŸ’¡ Challenge
Effectively managing JSON structures in Power Automate can seem daunting without a solid grasp of JSON structures and schemas.

## âœ… Solution
Master basic and advanced JSON handling techniques to streamline your Power Automate flows for better efficiency.

## ðŸ”§ How It's Done
Here's how to do it:
1. Basic Structure  
   ðŸ”¸ Use objects `{}` to define key-value pairs, where the key is a unique identifier and the value can contain data of various types.  
   
   {
     "name": "John Doe",
     "age": 30
   }
     
   ðŸ”¸ Use arrays `[]` to create an ordered list of values, ideal for storing multiple items of the same type.  
   
   ["Apple", "Banana", "Cherry"]
   
2. Type Restrictions  
   ðŸ”¸ Specify a specific data type for each field in your JSON schema to ensure correct formatting and interpretation; types can include `null` or an array of types for flexibility.  
   
   {
     "type": "object",
     "properties": {
       "name": { "type": "string" },
       "age": { "type": "number" },
