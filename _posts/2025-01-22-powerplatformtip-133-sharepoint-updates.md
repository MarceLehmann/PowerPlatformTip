## 💡 Challenge
Updating only specific fields in SharePoint items can be tricky. Often, you're forced to manage unnecessary required fields or rely on HTTP requests. Wouldn’t it be easier to simply update the fields you need?

## ✅ Solution
Use Power Automate with dynamic JSON data from variables to update only the necessary fields in SharePoint—without any HTTP requests or required field headaches.

## 🔧 How It's Done
Here's how to do it:

1. Define the Trigger  
   🔸 Use a trigger like “When an item is created or modified in SharePoint.”  
   🔸 This sets the flow into motion based on item updates.

2. Prepare JSON Data  
   🔸 Initialize a variable or use a Compose action called `UpdateData`.  
   🔸 Create a JSON object containing only the fields you want to update:
   ```json
   {
       "Status": "Completed"
   }
   ```

3. Update Item with Dynamic Data  
   🔸 Add the “Update Item” action to your flow.  
   🔸 Use the Site URL and List Name as usual.  
   🔸 Insert the `UpdateData` variable to update only the desired fields.

4. Test the Flow  
   🔸 Run the flow and verify that only the specified fields are changed.  
   🔸 Ensure that no errors occur due to untouched required fields.

## 🎉 Result
You get a lean and flexible Power Automate flow that updates only the fields you specify—saving time, avoiding required field errors, and making your flows easier to manage.

## 🌟 Key Advantages
🔸 Avoid unnecessary required field management  
🔸 Dynamic updates using minimal JSON configuration  
🔸 Cleaner, more maintainable flow structures

## 🛠️ FAQ
**1. Do I need to use HTTP requests to update specific SharePoint fields?**  
No! This method allows you to skip HTTP requests entirely by using built-in actions and dynamic JSON data.

**2. Will untouched required fields break the flow?**  
No. As long as the required fields already contain data, the flow can update other fields without issues.

**3. Can I use this method for multiple fields?**  
Absolutely. Just include all desired field-value pairs in the JSON object in your `UpdateData` variable.
