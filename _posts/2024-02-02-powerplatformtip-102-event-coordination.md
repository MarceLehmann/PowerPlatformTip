## ðŸ’¡ Challenge
Organizing event attendees in Power Automate can feel like herding cats. The usual methods often mean everyone gets an alert every time thereâ€™s a change, and to make matters worse, everyone can see who else is coming, leading to privacy concerns.

## âœ… Solution
Use the Graph APIâ€™s Update Event call to add attendees silently and set `hideAttendees` to true, preventing notifications and protecting privacy.

## ðŸ”§ How It's Done
Here's how to do it:
1. Kick things off with an HTTP request to retrieve the current event details, including attendees.  
   ðŸ”¸ Use the Microsoft Graph GET endpoint for the event.  
   ðŸ”¸ Include `?$select=attendees` to fetch existing guest list.
2. Build an array for the new guest with their name and email.  
   ðŸ”¸ Structure the attendee object with `emailAddress` and `type`.  
   ðŸ”¸ Ensure required fields like `status` are set.
3. Merge new and existing attendees using the `union` expression.  
   ðŸ”¸ Use `union(body('Get_event')?['attendees'], variables('newAttendees'))`.  
   ðŸ”¸ This prevents duplicates and preserves existing RSVPs.
4. Send the combined attendee list back to the event with an HTTP request.  
   ðŸ”¸ Use a PATCH call to `/events/{id}` on Graph API.  
   ðŸ”¸ Include `"attendees": mergedArray` and `"hideAttendees": true` in the JSON body.
5. OR: Take a shortcut and grab the whole setup from my GitHub.  
   ðŸ”¸ Visit: https://github.com/MarceLehmann/CodeSnippets/blob/main/EventCoordination.json

## ðŸŽ‰ Result
Attendees are added or updated on the DL, notification spam is minimized, and the guest list remains private, giving your event a VIP secrecy cloak.
