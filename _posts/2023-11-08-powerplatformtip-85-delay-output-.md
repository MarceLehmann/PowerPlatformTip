## 💡 Challenge
Immediate data updates with every user input can slow down your app and overload your data sources.

## ✅ Solution
Implement Delay Output in TextInput fields to improve performance and reduce unnecessary data traffic.

## 🔧 How It's Done
Here's how to do it:
1. Use Delay Output  
   🔸 Configure the Delay Output property on your TextInput control.  
2. Optimize update timing  
   🔸 Ensure updates and calculations occur only after the user has finished typing, not on each character.

## 🎉 Result
Enjoy a faster, more responsive app with optimized data handling.

## 🌟 Key Advantages
🔸 Improved Performance  
🔸 Reduced Load  
🔸 Efficient Data Traffic

## 🛠️ FAQ
**1. What does the Delay Output property do?**  
The Delay Output property postpones data updates until the user has paused typing, preventing updates on every keystroke.

**2. How do I enable Delay Output in my app?**  
Go to the TextInput control’s properties and set DelayOutput to true or specify the delay interval (in milliseconds) in DelayOutputMilliseconds.

**3. Will delaying output impact data accuracy?**  
No, Delay Output only optimizes when updates fire; final input values are still captured correctly upon submission.
