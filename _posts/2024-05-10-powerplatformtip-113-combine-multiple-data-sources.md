## ðŸ’¡ Challenge
Combining multiple data sources, including static data, into a single Power Apps project can be challenging. Merging multiple data sources with static data in Power Apps can create complexity in your appâ€™s data management.

## âœ… Solution
Use the `Ungroup` function to merge different data types into a unified, flat table structure, enhancing data interaction and usability.

## ðŸ”§ How It's Done
Here's how to do it:
1. Combine Data Sources: Mix static and dynamic data in an array.  
   ðŸ”¸ Create an array including objects with local static entries and tables from sources.  
   ðŸ”¸ Ensure the property name (e.g., locItem) is common across objects.  
2. Simplify Structure: Apply the `Ungroup` function to flatten complex data arrays into a single manageable format.  
   ðŸ”¸ Specify the common nested property as the target to ungroup (e.g., locItem).  
   ðŸ”¸ Confirm results return a flat table with all items.

Ungroup(
   [
      // Object 1
      {locItem:[{Date: Today(), ID:0}]},

      // Object 2
      {locItem: DelegationPlayground}
   ],
   // The 'locItem' property is specified as the common property to ungroup
