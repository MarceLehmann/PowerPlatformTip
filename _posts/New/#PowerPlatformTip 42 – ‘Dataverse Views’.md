## 💡 Challenge
Filtering large Dataverse tables directly in PowerApps Canvas Apps or PowerApps for Teams can be inefficient, leading to slow performance and complex formulas to show only relevant records.

## ✅ Solution
Use Dataverse Views with predefined filters (e.g., CurrentUser or date conditions) as data sources in your app to push filtering to the server and improve performance.

## 🔧 How It's Done
Here's how to do it:
1. Create a Dataverse View  
   🔸 In the Power Apps portal, navigate to Dataverse and your table.  
   🔸 Select **Add view** and specify filter criteria (e.g., Created By = Current User or Date older than X).
2. Save and publish the view  
   🔸 Give the view a clear name (e.g., "My Tasks - Current User").  
   🔸 Save and publish the customizations.
3. Use the view in PowerApps  
   🔸 In your Canvas App or PowerApps for Teams, add Dataverse as a data source.  
   🔸 Select your custom view instead of the default table.  
   🔸 Bind galleries or forms to this view to display filtered records only.

## 🎉 Result
Your app now retrieves and displays only the necessary records, reducing data load, speeding up load times, and providing a smoother user experience.

## 🌟 Key Advantages
🔸 Server-side filtering delivers only relevant data  
🔸 Enhanced app performance and faster load times  
🔸 Simplified app logic without complex filter formulas

## 🛠️ FAQ
**1. What is a Dataverse view?**  
A Dataverse view is a reusable, server-side query with predefined filters and column selections on a table that you can use as a data source in apps.

**2. Can I combine multiple filters in a view?**  
Yes, you can add multiple filter conditions (AND/OR) and even use dynamic filters like CurrentUser or relative date filters.

**3. Does using a view improve PowerApps performance?**  
Absolutely. Views offload filtering to the server, so your app downloads fewer records, which reduces data traffic and speeds up app responsiveness.
