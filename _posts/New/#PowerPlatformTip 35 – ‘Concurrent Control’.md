## 💡 Challenge
Managing multiple instances of a Power Automate flow can lead to data duplication and conflicts, especially when flows run in parallel and manipulate the same data set.

## ✅ Solution
Enable the Concurrency Control feature in Power Automate and set the degree of parallelism to 1 to ensure flows run sequentially, eliminating duplicates and conflicts.

## 🔧 How It's Done
Here's how to do it:
1. Navigate to your flow’s trigger settings.  
   🔸 Open the flow in Power Automate.  
   🔸 Click the trigger’s ellipsis (…) and choose “Settings.”
2. Enable Concurrency Control and set parallelism to 1.  
   🔸 Toggle on the “Concurrency Control” option.  
   🔸 Enter “1” for the degree of parallelism.
3. Validate sequential execution.  
   🔸 Confirm only one instance runs at a time.  
   🔸 Check additional triggers queue for execution after the current run.

## 🎉 Result
A more reliable and efficient automation process where data integrity is maintained and the risk of conflicts and duplicates is minimized.

## 🌟 Key Advantages
🔸 Data Integrity: Ensures each flow instance accesses and modifies data without interference.  
🔸 Sequential Execution: Queues flow instances for an orderly and predictable run sequence.  
🔸 Conflict Reduction: Limits concurrent runs to significantly reduce data conflicts.

## 🛠️ FAQ
**1. What is Concurrency Control in Power Automate?**  
Concurrency Control is a setting that limits the number of parallel flow instances by queuing additional triggers, ensuring flows execute one at a time.

**2. How do I configure Concurrency Control for a flow?**  
Open the flow’s trigger settings, enable “Concurrency Control,” and set the degree of parallelism to the desired number (e.g., 1).

**3. Will limiting concurrency impact the flow’s performance?**  
While setting parallelism to 1 may reduce throughput, it ensures data accuracy and prevents conflicts, which is critical for reliable automation.
