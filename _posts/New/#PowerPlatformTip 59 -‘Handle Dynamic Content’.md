## 💡 Challenge
When using expressions like `item()['id']` in Power Automate, flows can fail if the `id` property is missing from some items, causing errors and unreliable behavior.

## ✅ Solution
Leverage the safe navigation operator `?` to safely access properties, preventing errors by returning a `null` when a property is absent.

## 🔧 How It's Done
Here's how to do it:
1. Locate the dynamic content expression.  
   🔸 Identify expressions like `item()['id']` in your flow action.  
   🔸 Note that this expression throws an error if `id` is missing.
2. Add the safe navigation operator.  
   🔸 Update the expression to `item()?['id']`.  
   🔸 The `?` ensures the flow returns `null` instead of failing on missing properties.

## 🎉 Result
By using `item()?['id']`, your flows gracefully handle missing properties, returning `null` and avoiding crashes when processing inconsistent data.

## 🌟 Key Advantages
🔸 Prevents flow failures due to missing properties.  
🔸 Simplifies error handling by returning `null` instead of errors.  
🔸 Improves flow reliability when dealing with dynamic or inconsistent data.

## 🛠️ FAQ
**1. What is the safe navigation operator (?) in Power Automate?**  
The safe navigation operator (`?`) prevents runtime errors when accessing properties that may not exist on an object or array element, returning `null` instead of throwing an error.

**2. When should I use `item()?['property']` instead of `item()['property']`?**  
Use `item()?['property']` whenever a property might be missing or undefined to ensure your flow doesn’t fail and handles missing values gracefully.

**3. Will using the safe navigation operator affect performance?**  
No, the safe navigation operator has minimal performance impact and greatly improves the stability of your flows by avoiding unnecessary errors.
