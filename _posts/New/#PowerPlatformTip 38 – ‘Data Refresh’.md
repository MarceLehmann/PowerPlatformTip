## 💡 Challenge
Maintaining up-to-date data in PowerApps galleries is crucial for user experience. However, relying solely on the Refresh function reloads all data and can impact performance.

## ✅ Solution
Use a Boolean variable to trigger selective gallery data refresh, avoiding full data reloads and enhancing performance.

## 🔧 How It's Done
Here's how to do it:
1. Create a Boolean variable to control refresh.  
   🔸 Example: `Set(varRefreshGallery, false)` in the App's OnStart.  
   🔸 This variable determines when the gallery should update.
2. Toggle the variable when refresh is needed.  
   🔸 Add a button or icon with `OnSelect: Set(varRefreshGallery, true)`.  
   🔸 This signals the gallery to refresh its data source.
3. Use the variable in the gallery's Items property.  
   🔸 Example:  
     
     If(
       varRefreshGallery,
       Refresh(MyDataSource);
       Set(varRefreshGallery, false)
     );
     MyDataSource
       
   🔸 After the refresh, reset the variable to false.

## 🎉 Result
A responsive PowerApp where galleries update smoothly and efficiently without full data reloads, improving performance and user experience.

## 🌟 Key Advantages
🔸 Increased efficiency by loading only updated data  
🔸 Faster and smoother user experience  
🔸 Reduced network and server load

## 🛠️ FAQ
**1. Why should I use a Boolean variable for data refresh?**  
Using a Boolean variable allows you to control exactly when to refresh the gallery, avoiding full data reloads and improving app performance.

**2. How do I reset the Boolean variable after the gallery has refreshed?**  
After triggering the refresh, set the variable back to false (e.g., `Set(varRefreshGallery, false)`). This resets the trigger for future refreshes.

**3. Can I apply this pattern to multiple galleries or data sources?**  
Yes. You can create separate Boolean variables for each gallery or reuse one with additional logic, depending on your app design.
