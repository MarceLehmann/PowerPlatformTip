## 💡 Challenge
Integrating Google Maps into PowerApps presents a unique opportunity to enhance applications with dynamic map functionalities. The challenge lies in achieving this integration efficiently, without incurring excessive costs or requiring premium licenses, while providing users with accurate GPS location services.

## ✅ Solution
Use PowerApps’ built-in Location function to capture GPS coordinates, register for a Google Maps API key, and embed the map into your app. This enables advanced mapping features without extra licensing fees.

## 🔧 How It's Done
Here's how to do it:
1. Use PowerApps’ Location() function.  
   🔸 Retrieve real-time latitude and longitude.  
   🔸 Ensure device location permissions are enabled.  
2. Register for a Google Maps API account.  
   🔸 Enable the Maps JavaScript API in Google Cloud Console.  
   🔸 Obtain and restrict your unique API key.  
3. Embed Google Maps into your PowerApps.  
   🔸 Add the API key to an HTML text control or custom connector.  
   🔸 Configure the map control to render based on captured coordinates.

## 🎉 Result
Your PowerApps now display interactive Google Maps, offering users seamless, real-time location services and an enriched app experience without additional licensing costs.

## 🌟 Key Advantages
🔸 Cost Efficiency: 28,500 free map calls per month under Google’s $200 credit.  
🔸 No Premium Licenses Required: Works with standard PowerApps licensing.  
🔸 Enhanced User Experience: Direct access to rich mapping features inside your app.
