## 💡 Challenge
Data manipulation in Power Automate often requires merging or filtering datasets, which can feel like sorting through a mountain of information by hand.

## ✅ Solution
Use the UNION function to merge arrays and eliminate duplicates, and use FilterArray to sift and retain only desired items.

## 🔧 How It's Done
Here's how to do it:
1. Use UNION  
   🔸 The function merges two arrays into one.  
   🔸 When the same array is used twice, it removes duplicates (like DISTINCT).  
2. Use FilterArray  
   🔸 Iterates through an array and applies a condition to keep only matching items.  
3. Combine the functions  
   🔸 First merge with UNION, then apply FilterArray to the result for precise filtering.

## 🎉 Result
You can easily merge datasets, remove duplicates, and filter arrays, streamlining your workflows and ensuring data integrity.

## 🌟 Key Advantages
🔸 Efficiency: Complete complex data manipulation in minutes.  
🔸 Flexibility: Adaptable to various merging and filtering scenarios.  
🔸 Data Integrity: Built-in deduplication when using UNION with identical arrays.

## 🛠️ FAQ
**1. What does the UNION function do?**  
The UNION function merges two arrays into one, returning all unique elements and removing duplicates if the same array is used twice.

**2. How do I use FilterArray to find items?**  
FilterArray iterates through an array and applies a condition or expression to return only the items that match your criteria.

**3. Can I combine UNION and FilterArray in one flow?**  
Yes. You can merge arrays with UNION first and then apply FilterArray to the combined array for precise filtering in the same flow.
