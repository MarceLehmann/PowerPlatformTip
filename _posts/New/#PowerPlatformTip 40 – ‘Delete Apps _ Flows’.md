## 💡 Challenge  
Are you battling a chaotic workspace littered with outdated test apps and flows? Don’t worry! We’ve got your back with a step-by-step guide to efficiently eliminate solutions and declutter your workspace.

## ✅ Solution  
Our method ensures you can remove a bulk of apps or flows, especially test ones, by gathering them in a solution and applying the following steps for a tidier and more organized workspace.

## 🔧 How It's Done  
Here's how to do it:  
1. Gather all test apps and flows into a single unmanaged solution.  
   🔸 Open the Power Apps maker portal and navigate to **Solutions**.  
   🔸 Select **New solution** and add all target apps and flows.  
2. Verify there are no dependencies from other solutions, including connection references.  
   🔸 Check **Connection references** in the solution for any external links.  
   🔸 Resolve or remove any solution dependencies before proceeding.  
3. Export your solution as a managed solution.  
   🔸 In the solution details, choose **Export** > **Managed**.  
   🔸 Download the `.zip` package to your local machine.  
4. Delete the unmanaged solution (all elements will remain in your environment).  
   🔸 Select the unmanaged solution and click **Delete**.  
   🔸 Confirm removal—this only deletes the solution container.  
5. Re-import the managed solution.  
   🔸 Go to **Solutions** > **Import**, then upload the managed package.  
   🔸 Follow prompts to complete the import process.  
6. Delete the managed solution, which will then remove all old elements.  
   🔸 Select the managed solution and click **Delete**.  
   🔸 Confirm to permanently remove apps, flows, and related components.  

## 🎉 Result  
By following this process, you can effectively clear out all those unnecessary test apps and flows from your workspace, leading to a more streamlined and efficient working environment.

## 🌟 Key Advantages  
🔸 Efficient cleanup of large numbers of apps or flows.  
🔸 Maintains a neat and organized workspace.  
🔸 Ensures all elements are removed without leaving residuals.

## 🛠️ FAQ  
**1. Can I delete individual apps or flows without using solutions?**  
While you can delete items one by one, grouping them in a solution allows bulk operations and ensures no hidden dependencies remain.

**2. Will this method remove apps and flows permanently?**  
Yes. Exporting as a managed solution and then deleting the managed package removes all included components permanently.

**3. What if I have dependencies in my solution?**  
Resolve dependencies first by removing or reassigning connection references and related components before exporting and deleting the solution.
