## 💡 Challenge
In PowerApps and PowerAutomate, managing multiple potential blank values often results in complex, nested If statements. This hinders readability and efficiency.

## ✅ Solution
Use the Coalesce function to scan a list of parameters and return the first non-blank value, significantly reducing formula complexity.

## 🔧 How It's Done
Here's how to do it:
1. Use the Coalesce function with multiple values as parameters.  
   🔸 List all values as parameters in the Coalesce function instead of nested Ifs.  
2. Evaluate and return the first non-blank value.  
   🔸 Coalesce scans each parameter in order.  
   🔸 Returns the first non-blank value it encounters.

## 🎉 Result
Formulas become streamlined, improving readability, development efficiency, and future maintenance of your app or flow.

## 🌟 Key Advantages
🔸 Enhanced readability.  
🔸 Reduced complexity.  
🔸 Easier maintenance.
