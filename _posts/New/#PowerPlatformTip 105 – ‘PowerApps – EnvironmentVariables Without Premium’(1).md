## 💡 Challenge
Accessing environment variables in PowerApps requires a premium license, despite being freely available in Power Automate. This limitation contradicts the core advantage of environment variables: their ability to be used universally across platforms.

## ✅ Solution
Implement a simple Power Automate flow triggered on the PowerApp’s startup to fetch environment variables and store them in a local variable within the app.

## 🔧 How It's Done
Here's how to do it:
1. Create a flow within a solution to access environment variables, requiring only a trigger and a response.  
   🔸 Use the Power Apps trigger in the flow.  
   🔸 Keep the flow in the solution so it can reference environment variables.
2. Use a simple action to store and return the needed environment variable as a response.  
   🔸 Add the “Get environment variable” action.  
   🔸 Return the value using the response action.
3. Integrate this flow into your PowerApp, triggered by the OnStart event, to load the environment variable into a PowerApp variable.  
   🔸 Add the flow to your app via the Power Automate panel.  
   🔸 Call the flow in OnStart, assigning its output to a local variable.

## 🎉 Result
You can now use environment variables in PowerApps without a premium license, enhancing flexibility and efficiency in your app development.

## 🌟 Key Advantages
🔸 Universal Applicability: Environment variables can be used consistently across different platforms.  
🔸 Centralized Changes: Modifications need to be made only in one place, simplifying maintenance.  
🔸 Cost Efficiency: Avoids the need for a premium license to access environment variables in PowerApps.

## 🛠️ FAQ
**1. How can I retrieve environment variables in PowerApps without a premium license?**  
Use a Power Automate flow triggered from your PowerApp that fetches the environment variable and returns it to the app.

**2. Do I need a premium connector to use environment variables in Power Automate?**  
No, environment variables are available in Power Automate without a premium license when accessed within a solution.

**3. Can I update environment variables centrally?**
