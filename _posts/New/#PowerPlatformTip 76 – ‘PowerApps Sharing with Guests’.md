## 🛠️ FAQ
**1. Can I share a PowerApp with guests without using Teams Groups?**  
Yes, but managing individual guest permissions can be complex. Teams Groups centralize access control, making sharing and maintenance easier.

**2. How do I add or remove guests from a Teams Group?**  
You can manage guests directly in the Teams app under the group’s Members settings or automate it using Microsoft Graph API calls.

**3. What if guests cannot access the SharePoint backend?**  
Ensure that the Teams Group has proper SharePoint permissions. If issues persist, verify site permissions in SharePoint and adjust group settings accordingly.
