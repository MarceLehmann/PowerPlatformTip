## 🛠️ FAQ
**1. How does appending “.de” to the URL redirect me to the tips blog?**  
By adding “.de” at the end of a standard Power Platform domain, you’re directed to a curated blog subdomain that hosts all the quick tips.

**2. Does this trick work for all Power Platform portals?**  
Yes. You can append “.de” to any default portal URL (e.g., make.powerapps.com, make.powerautomate.com) to reach the tips blog.

**3. Will I need to sign in again when using the “.de” URLs?**  
No. Your existing authentication session carries over to the .de domain as long as your browser session is active.
