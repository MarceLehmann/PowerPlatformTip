## 💡 Challenge
Data manipulation in Power Automate often requires merging or filtering datasets, which can feel like sorting through a mountain of information by hand.

## ✅ Solution
Use the UNION function to merge arrays and eliminate duplicates, and use FilterArray to sift and retain only desired items.

## 🔧 How It's Done
Here's how to do it:
1. Use UNION  
   🔸 The function merges two arrays into one.  
   🔸 When the same array is used twice, it removes duplicates (like DISTINCT).  
2. Use FilterArray  
   🔸 Iterates through an array and applies a condition to keep only matching items.  
3. Combine the functions  
   🔸 First merge with UNION, then apply FilterArray to the result for precise filtering.

## 🎉 Result
You can easily merge datasets, remove duplicates, and filter arrays, streamlining your workflows and ensuring data integrity.

## 🌟 Key Advantages
🔸 Efficiency: Complete complex data manipulation in minutes.  
🔸 Flexibility: Adaptable to various merging and filtering scenarios.  
🔸 Data Integrity: Built-in deduplication when using UNION with identical arrays.

## 🛠️ FAQ
**1. Does UNION automatically remove duplicates?**  
Yes, UNION automatically removes duplicate entries when combining arrays, ensuring unique values in the result.

**2. Can I use FilterArray with complex nested objects?**  
Absolutely! FilterArray works with complex objects and supports advanced expressions to filter based on nested properties.

**3. What's the performance impact of combining UNION and FilterArray?**  
These functions are optimized for performance, but with very large datasets, consider processing in batches to maintain optimal flow execution times.
