## 💡 Challenge
Designing menus in Power Apps with individual buttons leads to inconsistent layouts, tedious styling, and manual updates for each item.

## ✅ Solution
Leverage the Gallery control to render menu items dynamically from a single data source, ensuring uniform appearance and simplified maintenance.

## 🔧 How It's Done
Here's how to do it:
1. Insert a Gallery  
   🔸 In the toolbar choose **Insert > Gallery > Blank Vertical**.  
   🔸 Position it where you want your menu to appear.
2. Set the Items property  
   🔸 Define a collection or table, e.g.  
     powerapps
     ClearCollect(MenuItems, 
       {Icon: Icon.Home, Label: "Home", Screen: HomeScreen},
       {Icon: Icon.Settings, Label: "Settings", Screen: SettingsScreen},
       {Icon: Icon.Help, Label: "Help", Screen: HelpScreen}
     );
     
   🔸 Set `Gallery.Items = MenuItems`.
3. Design the template  
   🔸 Inside the gallery, add an **Icon** control and set `Icon = ThisItem.Icon`.  
   🔸 Add a **Label** control and set `Text = ThisItem.Label`.  
   🔸 Apply theme colors and spacing for a polished look.
4. Configure navigation  
   🔸 Select the template and set  
     `OnSelect = Navigate(ThisItem.Screen, ScreenTransition.Fade)`.  
   🔸 Optionally highlight the selected item using a conditional fill.
5. Maintain your menu  
   🔸 To add or remove items, update the `MenuItems` data source or collection.  
   🔸 Changes appear instantly without modifying multiple controls.

## 🎉 Result
A dynamic, data-driven menu that maintains consistent styling, scales easily with new items, and improves the user experience.

## 🌟 Key Advantages
🔸 Consistency across all menu items with a single template.  
🔸 Flexibility to add, remove, or reorder entries by updating the data source.  
🔸 Simplified maintenance and fewer controls to manage.

## 🛠️ FAQ
**1. What is the advantage of using a Gallery over individual buttons?**  
A Gallery lets you define a single layout template and data-bind it, providing uniform styling and centralized maintenance for all menu entries.

**2. Can I use images or custom icons in a gallery?**  
Yes. You can add image controls inside the gallery template and set their `Image` or `Icon` property to a URL or icon constant from your data source.

**3. Does using a Gallery affect performance?**  
Galleries support virtualization for large data sets. For typical menu sizes (5–10 items), performance is excellent and simplifies your app’s logic.
