> **TL;DR:** Build data-driven menus from a single Gallery template instead of individual buttons for consistent styling and one-place maintenance.

## 💡 Challenge

Designing menus in Power Apps with individual buttons leads to inconsistent layouts, tedious styling, and manual updates for each item.

## ✅ Solution

Leverage the Gallery control to render menu items dynamically from a single data source, ensuring uniform appearance and simplified maintenance.

## 🔧 How It's Done

**1. Insert a Gallery**

🔸 In the toolbar choose **Insert > Gallery > Blank Vertical**.

🔸 Position it where you want your menu to appear.

**2. Set the Items property**

🔸 Define a collection or table, e.g.

```powerapps
ClearCollect(MenuItems,
  {Icon: Icon.Home, Label: "Home", Screen: HomeScreen},
  {Icon: Icon.Settings, Label: "Settings", Screen: SettingsScreen},
  {Icon: Icon.Help, Label: "Help", Screen: HelpScreen}
);
```

🔸 Set `Gallery.Items = MenuItems`.

**3. Design the template**

🔸 Inside the gallery, add an **Icon** control and set `Icon = ThisItem.Icon`.

🔸 Add a **Label** control and set `Text = ThisItem.Label`.

🔸 Apply theme colors and spacing for a polished look.

**4. Configure navigation**

🔸 Select the template and set `OnSelect = Navigate(ThisItem.Screen, ScreenTransition.Fade)`.

🔸 Optionally highlight the selected item using a conditional fill.

**5. Maintain your menu**

🔸 To add or remove items, update the `MenuItems` data source or collection.

🔸 Changes appear instantly without modifying multiple controls.

## 🎉 Result

A dynamic, data-driven menu that keeps consistent styling, scales easily with new items, and improves the user experience.

## 🌟 Key Advantages

🔸 Consistency across all menu items with a single template

🔸 Flexibility to add, remove, or reorder entries by updating the data source

🔸 Simplified maintenance and fewer controls to manage

## 🛠️ FAQ

**Q: What is the advantage of using a Gallery over individual buttons?**

A Gallery lets you define a single layout template and data-bind it, providing uniform styling and centralized maintenance for all menu entries.

**Q: Can I use images or custom icons in a gallery?**

Yes. Add image controls inside the gallery template and set their `Image` or `Icon` property to a URL or icon constant from your data source.

**Q: Does using a Gallery affect performance?**

Galleries support virtualization for large data sets. For typical menu sizes (5–10 items), performance is excellent and simplifies your app's logic.
